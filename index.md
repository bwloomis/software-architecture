## Welcome to the IASA Global Software Architecture course!

### Introduction
This page is the welcome page for the materials we develop in the hands-on lab portion of [IASA's software architecture course](https://iasaglobal.org/Public/Events/SOFTWARE-ONLINE-COURSE.aspx?EventKey=OESFTW0621&WebsiteKey=aef6b934-7501-4d22-a007-6ea08dfa6882).  If you are in one of the course sections, you will have email from your instructor on additional resources required for the HOLs, certification as a software architect, course meeting times and modality.  If you are interested in taking this course, please visit the [IASA training calendar](https://iasaglobal.org/Public/Learn/Copy_of_Training-Calendar/Public/Events/Events.aspx).  General information about other IASA programs and services can be found [here](https://iasaglobal.org/).

### How the source is organized
The materials (accessed by the button above) are hosted on GitHub and are organized by folder for each hands-on lab:
1. Object-relationship mapping and OpenAPI specs
2. Containers and cloud deployment
3. User interfaces
4. Mobility
5. Integrations
6. DevOps
7. Messages and eventing
8. Inter-environment communications
9. Information architecture and non-relational storage

Each folder is a complete downloadable set of folders and is versioned for stage of the lab by branch.  The hands-on lab (HOL) assumes you have downaloded the initial framework for the lab from the "starter" branch.  Each HOL has various intermediate points, where you can "catch up" or get more help on specifics.  These are labelled "intermediate-1" in sequence according to the lab guide.  There is always the main branch (also tagged "completed") which represents the finished solution.  This is downloadable, compilable and executable as a prerequisite to later HOLs.
Please see the course Microsoft Teams site for the latest HOL guides, which are Word or PDF documents.  Each HOL in the repository has a README.md with instructions on prerequisite tools, how to build the solution, and additional technical information.
**consider changing this to all .MD online for the HOL docs...**

### References to T-Coffee Loyalty case study
The case study for Tinkleman's T-Coffee Loyalty Program upgrade has a number of artifacts describing the initial requirements and design. These are online as well, in the  /Requirements folder.
1. Textual requirements description
2. Service blueprint (business layer)
3. Sequence diagram and state-transition diagram for orders with Point-of-Sale
4. Initial data model

## Course references
Since we are dealing with technical tools and processes, related reference material and online articles are located in the following folders under /References as individual markdown documents.
- By course module/topic
- Useful tools listing
- Tools used during the course (familiarity)
