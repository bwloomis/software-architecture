# Generally useful tools

This article shares a number of tools - some older, some newer - for the architect to use to quickly and efficiently perform various tasks described in the software lifecycle and this course.  

The architect also tries to select tools that help simplify complexity and improve quality of both the solution and the software code.  Some concerns with tool selection include:
* how well the tool works with others (handoff of one artifact to the next stage, tools embeddable in other tools and systems)
* how shareable the tool's artifacts will be (shareable with team members, shareable with customers)
* how close the tool is to the implementation (diagram specifies the implementation, accuracy, ability to generate multiple views and abstract/simplify single views)
* cost
* for drawing tools, how modern the picture looks, and how touch-enabled it is (often used for marketing!)
